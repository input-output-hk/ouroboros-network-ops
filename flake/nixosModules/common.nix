    #   b) Auth keys hub is deployed as the sole source of authorized keys
    #      * Later, auth-keys-hub is removed from the deployment, but adding additional authorized_keys was forgotten
    #      * Machine lockout occurs
    #   c) Solar flare EMP knocking out a large number of machines over a large geographic area for some period of time
    #      * Github api is not available to pull fresh authorized key state and the ephermal storage was lost during reboot
